artistbio: "**Artist Biography**\n\nLatvian artist Zane Žeivate’s work is deeply ingrained in her lived experience, exploring the boundaries between human made environment and feelings that in places such as cities are considered as vulnerabilities. Blending performances with autobiographical methods and giving a voice through her personal narrative while laying it as a basis for an objective understanding of the concerned issues, she reveals the intimacy of fears and hopes experienced in the man made environment, rethinking the impact of the feelings to change our perception toward the patriarchal society."

"The Reflected Presence" video work was a part of site specific installation in Maison Descartes, questioning power dynamics through spacial contexts of our built environments. A corner of a room is to be observed allowing a spectators to catch the differences in the perception on the same corner before and after a female character is appearing. It feels like reflecting never ends, I absorb and reflect. One day I absorb, the next I reflect. And then, I meet you and I reflect of my yesterday’s absorption and now you absorb. It is the time to reflect on what I have been absorbing. Absorbing patriarchy. It was an empty corner just a second ago and the walls were just walls.
