It's 1973, Fernanda is thirteen years old and has embarked on a journey with her friend Beatriz across Colombia to reach Santa Marta on the Atlantic coast. During the trip, Fernanda will leave the bubble of her neighbourhood in Bogot√°, transgressing the vast and plural territory in front of her. She will meet along the way a series of women carrying stories and conceptions of territory from where other territorialities and historiographies from Colombia are drawn.
